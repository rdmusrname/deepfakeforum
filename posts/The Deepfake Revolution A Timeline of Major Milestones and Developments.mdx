# **The Deepfake Revolution: A Timeline of  Major Milestones and Developments**

In the realm of digital media, deepfakes have  emerged as a  transformative force,  reshaping our perception  of reality  and challenging traditional notions of authenticity. Fueled by advancements in artificial  intelligence (AI) and  deep learning, deepfakes have evolved from  mere curiosities into sophisticated  tools capable of producing remarkably realistic fake videos and audio content. This article  embarks on a chronological journey through the major milestones and developments that have shaped the deepfake revolution, offering a comprehensive overview of this rapidly evolving field.


## **2017:  The Dawn of Deepfakes**

The year 2017 marked the  genesis of  deepfakes, as the term was coined and the first wave of manipulated videos surfaced online. These early attempts often crude and unconvincing nonetheless hinted  at the immense potential and disruptive implications of deepfake technology.

## **2018: Deepfakes  Gain Traction**


* **Early Deepfake Videos Go Viral:**  By  2018, deepfake videos began to circulate widely across  social media platforms capturing the attention of the general public. Notably,  a deepfake video depicting former US President Barack Obama delivering a speech that he never gave garnered significant media attention, sparking discussions about the potential misuse of this technology.

*  **Celebrities  and Politicians  Targeted:** Deepfakes quickly became a tool for creating non-consensual pornography and spreading misinformation. Prominent celebrities, including Scarlett  Johansson and Emma Watson found themselves subjected  to deepfake pornographic content without their consent,  highlighting the urgent need for safeguards and regulations.

##  **2019: Deepfake Technology Advances**

* **Increased Realism and Sophistication:** Deepfake technology  witnessed a quantum leap in 2019 with  the release of increasingly realistic and sophisticated fake videos  and audios. This advancement was largely attributed to the availability of more powerful computing resources  coupled with the refinement of AI algorithms.

* **Voice  Cloning Emerges:** Voice cloning, a subset of deepfake technology, gained  traction, enabling the  creation of synthetic speech that  could mimic the voice of  targeted individuals with uncanny  accuracy. This development opened up new avenues for spreading misinformation and impersonating public figures.
